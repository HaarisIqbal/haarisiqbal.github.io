                                Created a custom variation of Gale-Shapley’s Deferred Acceptance algorithm, 
                                expanded to be applied to a many-to-one setting; in particular, matching students to (final year) projects. 
                                The final outcome of the FYP is a Student-Project Matching Program utilising this algorithm. 
                                Some main achievements include the following:
                            </p>

                                    Innovative adaptation to a many-to-one system by implementing an 
                                    acceptance criterion rather than a preference list for proposées in the algorithm 
                                    (and allowing for a preference list of variable length in the case of proposers).
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                    Maintaining Gale-Shapley’s theorems with careful algorithmic design considerations: 
                                    thereby remaining “stable” and “optimal” despite extensive increase in complexity. 
                                    Most critically, students are still placed in best achievable matching.

                                Final program was written in Java with GUI in Java Swing. 
                                Deep technical decision making was maintained as a forefront, with systematic, 
                                software engineering practices upheld throughout development 
                                (Javadoc, TDD with JUnit 5 Jupiter, Google Checkstyle, etc.), and high cohesion, low coupling software design.

                                Created a novel programming language for 2D image processing using the ART specification 
                                (ART is a tool for specifying the syntax and semantics of language processors). 
                                This involved the following tasks:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="fa-ul mb-3">

                                    Defining an internal prefix syntax for the domain-specific language (named PLIP).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i></span>
                                    Designing a language specification and an external syntax for PLIP.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i></span>
                                    Writing ART BNF grammar for PLIP, with the use of GIFT operators to parse programs written 
                                    in PLIP's external syntax (effectively an external-to-internal translator).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i></span>
                                    Writing ART elided-SOS rules that implements an interpreter for PLIP (conforming to PLIP's specifications).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i></span>
                                    Writing ART BNF grammar for PLIP, to form the basis of an attribute grammar interpreter 
                                    (conforming to PLIP's specifications) and decorating the attribute grammar interpreter 
                                    with actions written in Java (JavaFX) to implement the interpreter.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                The theme for the external syntax is an over-the-top "polite" articulation, which is 
                                why this programming language has been named "PLIP".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                PLIP is able to perform full arithmetic (BODMAS), while featuring standard commands (such as 'if' 
                                and 'while' statements), and it can load and manipulate 2D images (flipping, rotating, contrasting, etc).

                                Created a console-interface "hacking" video game as a part of Royal Hackaway v5, Hackathons UK. 
                                The game was designed to emulate the popular, stereotypical culture of hacking portrayed in media. 
                                Built simple pseudo-attack commands along with in-game missions to emulate the experience of being an hacker.

                                Collaborated over Git. Worked in a team of four. 
                                My primary areas of focus were on the Log section of the console and on scripting missions.

                                Created a 2D Chess video game as part of Royal Hackaway v4, Hackathons UK. 
                                The game was designed to be an enchanced version of traditional chess, introducing power-ups that can be accessed by a point system.
                                This fundamentally changes the strategy in which the game is played. Some of the power-ups in the game include:

                                    Double Turn - Any color can use their accumilated points to play two moves in their turn (one use only).
                                </li>

                                (for example stronger enemies, new behaviours such as arrows exploding, etc).
                                Written in Java, using Spigot API.

                                Project Grade: Achieved a mark of 100%, and went on to be awarded a Distinction in the course overall.

                                Created a full-fledged standalone database application with a GUI frontend 
                                (featuring an image display) and a MySQL database backend. Notably, good practice 
                                was learned and implemented during development despite novelty to software design. 
                                Process included substantial GUI and Database testing.
                                Written in Python3, with Python Imaging Library (PIL) and Tkinter.

                                GameMaker Studio video game designed and built from scratch as MYP Personal Project. 
                                Primarily worked with GameMaker interface, wrote GML code for entity movement and enemy behaviour.
                                The project features custom made sprites and audio, with a carefully designed objective (beginning and end).
