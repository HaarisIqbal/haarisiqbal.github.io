                                Mocca coffee (the subsidiary company of Capventures) is a popular café with multiple locations in major cities throughout Pakistan. 
                                Since their launch, they have lacked a website, and have mostly relied on social media to highlight their menu, outlets, etc. 
                                As a web developer, I was tasked with designing, building, testing, and deploying their website. 
                                My work primarily revolved around frontend development. 
                                I coordinated with many other employees for specifically required assets and illustrations (such as implementing their custom font) and I was responsible for development of huge elements of the project, including the landing page, menu, locations page, customer carousel, etc. 
                                I handled programming and project management with a fellow developer, and working with only one other developer resulted in myself handling major decisions and design choices, and holistically contributing to the project. 
                                I refactored code and optimized the website for both desktop and mobile accessibility, by incorporating elements to adapt to all platforms (e.g collapsible navbar, auto-stacking buttons, touch/swipe friendly carousels). 
                                Outside of programming, I contributed on helping management in choosing domain name along with performing presentations and demos of the website to executives. 
                                I extensively tested, restructured and built the UI & UX of the site, adapting it based on feedback from clients and beta-testers. 
                                Once a domain had been chosen, I purchased the domain and deployed the site; 
                                installed the SSL certificate and forced https redirect, making the site secure.

                                Upon the completion of robotics club, myself and one other student were invited by our instructor to 
                                engage in specialized, advanced lessons outside of school. 
                                Our course covered the fundamentals of robotics, software, and project developement.

                                We examined the anatomy of programming, looking at the difference between event and 
                                conditional commands. We worked extensively with arduinos and with lazers, even breaking 
                                down lazers to examine their parts, and discussing lazers as circuit breakers (a major 
                                project that was undertaken by BelBots). Our final project was a maze-navigating robot, 
                                programmed in C#

                    <p>
                        I'm a very sporty person, and I've always enjoyed outdoor activities. 
                        In my past, I was typically involved with sports such as Athletics and Football. 
                        Nowadays, I'm into playing Tennis (although my serve needs a lot of work). 
                        I've also been golfing and cycling since I was a child.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At university, I've been involved in a number of sports and societies, 
                        but I'm mostly interested in trying new things, 
                        which is why I've really enjoyed visiting new places, meeting people at social events, trying new food, drinks, activities, etc. 
                        During times I'm not doing that, you might find me studying or reading books in cafes or in the library 
                        (I used to be a very avid reader when I was young, and I still read the occasional book from time to time).
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-0">
                        As well as keeping up with whatever favourite TV show I have during the season, this is roughly the kind of things I'm up to in my (very limited) free time. 
                        I'm also really passionate about computing and software development, but this personal interest is often mostly highlighted outside my course in the summers, 
                        where I have the time to work on passion projects. 
                        Sadly, several of the small programming masterpieces I create never become anything worth showing off 
                        (for example, little AutoGUI bots or small programs / algorithms) 
                        - but I really enjoy working on them nonetheless :)

                            <p>
                                Created a custom variation of Gale-Shapely’s Deferred Acceptance algorithm, 
                                expanded to be applied to a many-to-one setting; in particular, matching students to (final year) projects. 
                                The final outcome of the project is a Student-Project Matching Program utilising this algorithm. 
                                Some main achievements include the following:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="fa-ul mb-3">

                                    Innovative adaptation to a many-to-one system by implementing an 
                                    acceptance criteria rather than a preference list for proposées in the algorithm 
                                    (and allowing for a preference list of variable length in the case of proposers).
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                    Maintaining Gale-Shapley’s theorems with careful algorithmic design considerations: 
                                    thereby remaining “stable” and “optimal” despite extensive increase in complexity. 
                                    Most critically, students are still placed in best achievable matching.

                                Final program was written in Java with GUI in Java Swing. 
                                Deep technical decision making was maintained as a forefront, with systematic, 
                                software engineering practices upheld throughout development 
                                (JavaDoc, TDD with JUnit 5 Jupiter, Google Checkstyle, etc.), and high cohesion, low coupling software design.

                                Created a console-interface "hacking" video game as a part of Royal Hackaway v5, Hackathons UK. 
                                The game was designed to emulate the popular, stereotypical culture of hacking portrayed in media. 
                                Built simple pseudo-attack commands along with in-game missions to emulate the experience of being an hacker.

                            <p>
                                Developed and written in C# using the Unity Engine within 26 hour time constraint. 
                                Collaborated over Git. Worked in a team of four. 
                                My primary areas of focus were on the Log section of the console and on scripting missions.

                                Created a 2D Chess video game as part of Royal Hackaway v4, Hackathons UK. 
                                The game was designed to be an enchanced version of traditional chess, introducing power-ups that can be accessed by a point system.
                                This fundamentally changes the strategy in which the game is played. Some of the power-ups in the game include:

                                Created numerous server plugins for popular video game Minecraft.

                                (for example stronger enemies, new behaviours such as arrows exploding, etc).
                                Written in Java, using Spigot API.
